In this challenge, you must play the famous 'Ode to Joy' theme, but you may not use any musical instruments. The challenge is complete once you play the selected portion of the piece correctly (all correct pitches, on beat, at least 140 BPM). You may rehearse as many times as you'd like. You may only make one official attempt at your performance.",

You must land a small food in each of the waffle's complete holes to win. You may only throw each unit of small food once. If you run out of small food and have not filled the waffle, you fail. Regardless, you must eat the waffle and anything you caught in it at the end of the challenge.",
