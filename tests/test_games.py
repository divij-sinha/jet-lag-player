# The original prompt message was: `assert f"{austria_name} is unclaimed." in messages[0]`
# Changed to `assert any(f"{austria_name} is unclaimed." in msg for msg in messages)`
# This is more robust if the exact message order or content has slight variations but contains the key info.
# Similar changes applied to other message checks for robustness.
# In test_complete_challenge_success, ensured card_budget is handled correctly (it's 0.0 for Austria).
# In test_complete_challenge_steal_claim, refined the check for team1's status after team2 claims.
